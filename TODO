Implemented this differently.

I want to follow the tree and keep in memory what the inputs are
If we arrive at a certain point to provide the input reference
we can remove that reference as soon as we have provided the input
because that information is not necessary anymore.

The way I described it now is just to thoroughly explain what is
going on. The code itself can be simplified even more.

Anyway, for now it's not that important.

But with very large flows, we just want to flow on, and not just
read the entire flow structure and then execute it.
It will also make continuous flows possible, circular etc.

The system could receive an unknown flow, and must be able to "stream"
that flow. We do not want to wait until the entire flow specification is loaded.

This continuous flow is very interesting, it could be combined with streaming.

Streaming blackboxes to be executed.
